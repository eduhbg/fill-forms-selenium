# Fill forms with Selenium

## Overview

The project aims to study Selenium test tool and its use with Python for form filling.

I started studying Selenium after I needed to register some data in a web application of my work. I had a spreadsheet with more than 8,000 entries and I used the tool to register some of them.

There are other faster ways to fill out forms, like using `requests` in Python. However, it was interesting to see how this tool works and how could be applied in other projects.

## Running the project

In this project there is already a form created by me to perform the tests, as well as a file with data, `financial_sample.xlsx`, which will be used in the execution of this project.

Just run the script `app.py` and see the result.
